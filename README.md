# Hybrid-Sort

This project compares four sorting algorithms: Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. The goal is to analyze their performance and determine the most efficient sorting method based on different scenarios.

## Graphs were generated to illustrate sorting times for different input sizes. The results highlight:

- Insertion Sort is efficient for small datasets but performs poorly on large datasets.

- Heap Sort and Merge Sort usually maintain O(n log n) complexity.

- Quick Sort is fast in general but can degrade to O(nÂ²) in the worst case.

- Hybrid Sort efficiently combines Merge Sort and Insertion Sort for optimal performance.

## Features

-  Utilizes a hybrid approach to enhance sorting efficiency.
-  Designed to handle various data sizes and distributions effectively.
-  Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate module for clarity and reusability.
