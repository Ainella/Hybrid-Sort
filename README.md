# Hybrid-Sort

## Overview

Hybrid-Sort is an algorithm that combines the strengths of multiple sorting techniques to optimize performance. By leveraging different sorting methods, it aims to achieve efficient sorting across various data sets and conditions.

## Features

-  Utilizes a hybrid approach to enhance sorting efficiency.
-  Designed to handle various data sizes and distributions effectively.
-  Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate module for clarity and reusability.


### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.

Compile the Code:
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o hybrid_sort

Run the Executable:
./hybrid_sort
